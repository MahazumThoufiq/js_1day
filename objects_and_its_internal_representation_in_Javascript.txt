   JavaScript is a versatile and dynamic programming language that powers the interactive aspects of many websites and web applications. One of its fundamental features is the concept of objects. Objects play a crucial role in JavaScript programming and are at the heart of its flexible and object-oriented nature. In this blog, we'll dive into what objects are, how they are represented internally in JavaScript.

What Are Objects in JavaScript:

   In JavaScript, an object is a complex data type that allows you to store a collection of key-value pairs. These key-value pairs are often referred to as properties, where the key is a string (or symbol) and the value can be of any data type, including other objects, functions, and primitive values like strings, numbers, and booleans. Objects are used to represent entities, concepts, or structures in your code, making it easier to organize and manage data.

Internal Representation of Objects:

   At a low level, how does JavaScript actually store and manipulate objects internally? To understand this, we need to delve into memory management and the concept of references.

   Understanding the internal representation of objects is essential for efficient programming and optimizing memory usage. In JavaScript, objects are implemented as dynamic, unordered collections of properties. The most common way to create an object is by using object literal.

1. References:
   In JavaScript, objects are not stored directly in variables; instead, what is stored is a reference to the memory location where the object is stored. This reference mechanism is crucial for memory efficiency and handling complex data structures.

const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
};

const anotherPerson = person; // Here, anotherPerson holds a reference to the same object

In the example above, person and anotherPerson both refer to the same object in memory. This reference-based approach allows objects to be easily shared and passed around without duplicating the entire object.

2. Properties and Methods:
   Properties and methods of an object are essentially key-value pairs, where the key is the property or method name, and the value is the associated data or function. Properties are accessible using dot notation or square brackets:

console.log(person.name); // Outputs: "John"
console.log(person['age']); // Outputs: 30

3. Prototypes and Inheritance:
   JavaScript objects can also have prototypes, which are other objects from which they inherit properties and methods. This forms the basis of JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance model. When you access a property or method on an object, JavaScript will search for it in the object itself and its prototype chain until it either finds the property or reaches the end of the chain.

4. Creating Objects:
   There are various ways to create objects in JavaScript:

Object literals: {} syntax to define key-value pairs.
Constructor functions: Using functions to create instances of objects.
ES6 Classes: A more structured way to create objects using class syntax.

5. Object Manipulation:
   JavaScript provides a variety of methods to manipulate objects, including adding, modifying, and deleting properties.

person.job = "Engineer"; // Adding a property
person.age = 31; // Modifying a property
delete person.job; // Deleting a property
